# Blog Gatsby Contentful

This is a project that demonstrates how to create a blog using Gatsby, Contentful, TypeScript, GraphQL, Styled Components, and Sass.

## Technologies Used

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/): A fast, modern static-site generator for React.
- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/): A headless CMS that allows you to manage and deliver content via API.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A superset of JavaScript that adds static types for better development experience.
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/): A query language for APIs that provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to the traditional REST API.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/): A CSS-in-JS styling framework that allows you to write CSS styles in JavaScript.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/): A popular CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.
